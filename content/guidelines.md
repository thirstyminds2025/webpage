# 🚀 Community Guidelines 

Welcome to our tech-tinkering corner of the world! Here’s how we roll:

## ✅ What We Do

- **Learn, Test, Break, Build** — We’re all about experimenting with tech stacks, especially the ones that seem scary to beginners or intermediate folks. Get your hands dirty. No shame in the struggle.

- **Support Open Tech** — While we’re not a strict FOSS (Free and Open Source Software) group, we do operate and contribute within the FOSS spirit: freedom, collaboration, and openness.

- **Encourage FOSS** — We love free and open tools, and we encourage their use—but we won’t gatekeep if you’re using non-FOSS tech. Everyone's on their own learning curve.

- **Tool-Agnostic Learning** — Whether it's pure FOSS, open tech, or other tools, we're not here to draw boundaries. Our focus is on learning, experimenting, and building real things—using whatever helps best in the moment. Choose what works, share what you learn.

- **Share Knowledge Freely** — Tutorials, tips, hacks, fails, wins—dump it all here. This is how we grow.

- **Bridge Gaps** — Whether you're loaded with resources or just starting out with curiosity, this space is for mixing minds and helping each other up.

## ❌ What We Don't Do

- **No Tech Elitism** — We all started somewhere. No question is "too basic." Be kind and patient.

- **No Spam, Self-Promo Overload, or Selling** — This isn’t a marketplace. A cool project or resource? Yes. Just marketing? Nope.

- **No Hard Policing of Tools** — We don’t restrict what tools you use, but if you want to contribute, we stick to FOSS for transparency and collaboration.

- **No Rigid Formalities** — We’re informal, experimental, and fun. Just keep it respectful and constructive.

## ⚡️ Tone & Culture

Think of this as your experimental garage with open doors.  
Learning is messy. Failing is part of the process.  
**Fun? Yes. Memes? Occasional. Chaos? Controlled.**  
Respect each other, share the mic, and let’s make tech less scary for everyone.
